## TwitterBot
#### Automatically sign into twitter, search a hashtag and like posts

Just a silly project to play with selenium.

requires a config.py containing:
* USERNAME = "mytwitterusername"
* PASSWORD = "mytwitterpassword"
* HASHTAG = "webdev"
* PAGES = 25 # how many times the page will scroll down before collecting tweets
